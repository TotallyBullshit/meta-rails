Description:

Example:
    ./script/generate meta_scaffold databaseModelFile options

    By default this will create the models and migrations for given database codified in databaseModelFile,
    options can be:
     * nomigrations -> migrations won't be generated.
     * nomodels -> models won't be generated.
     * withcontrollers -> generate also the controllers.
     * fromdb -> The database model used will be infered from the actual db (a fake databaseModelFile is needed
    in order to parse de script options).
     * incremental -> The generator will search for differences between the db and given databaseModelFile, then will made
     the required migrations.

    The meta_scaffold generator tries to execute the hook if is defined to execute it you must define 
    a method called meta_scaffold_generator_classes_hook(classes). You can use the atomatically loaded 
    file at RAILS_ROOT/lib/meta_scaffold_generator_hook.rb to define it.
    
    The aim of the meta_scaffold_generator_classes_hook(classes) method must be correct or modify the 
    classes struct that its the representation of the schema that MetaScaffold generator will use in 
    order to generate the files. The classes struct follows the next convention:

            { class_name_1 => {"class_attr"=>{"attr_name_1"=>"attr_type_1", ...},
                         "class_ass" => [ {"ass_type_1" => "relation_1"}, {..}, ... ] }
       
       Ej: { "lexical_entry" => { "class_attr" => {"created_on"=>"date", "name"=>"string"}, 
                 "class_ass" => [ {"has_many"=>"senses"}, {"has_many"=>"syntactic_behaviours"},
                                  {"belongs_to"=>"lexicon"}]
                                },
             ... }
