<h1>MetaRails - DRY to the limit</h1>

<h2>What is MetaRails?</h2>
    <p>
    One of the killer features of Ruby on Rails is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), this is
    absolutelly true but when you work a lot with RoR you feel that something could be
    still more DRY. This is the motivation of MetaRails.
    </p>
    <p>
    Mainly, MetaRails is a generator of simple database based web applications. Given a db schema
    it generates automaticly the database, the view-insert-modify views for each table of the database
    or model of the application, and inferes the webservices that may play with the database data.
    </p>
    <p>
    Well, but not all the web applications are simple database web applications, we know this
    and because of this we are developing the proyect in a modular way using plugins in order to
    permit developers to use only the DRY magic that they need.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the moment MetaRails is in heavy preliminar development but we are advancing fast and we expect
    release a beta version soon.
    </p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

    <p>
        MetaRails is divided in four parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>MetaRails gem</b>, script build as a ruby gem that simplify instalation and creation of new MetaRails applications</li>
        <li><b>Mega Scaffold</b>, rails plugin that creates the database and view-insert-modify views (scaffold). </li>
        <li><b>Mega Querier</b>, rails plugin that permits any kind of queries to the database and export them to multiples formats.</li>
        <li><b>Mega WebServices</b>, rails plugin that inferes webservices for the database.</li>
    </ul>

        If you have played a bit with Ruby you will belive us when we say that we are enjoying a lot developing
        MetaRails. This project let us digg a lot into RoR and Ruby internals and learn so much.
