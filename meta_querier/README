=MetaQuerier

MetaQuerier is a RubyOnRails plugin that is a part of MetaRails. Its aim is to make any kind of query to a database in a RubyOnRails application with zero configuration.

MetaQuerier detects the structure of the application models. Shows a diagram of the application and offers a custom form for building queries and browsing its data.

It also permits save and load queries, and parametrice them allowing made conditions fixed or variables.
If you save a query with variable conditions then when you run this query MetaQuerier ask you for the condition value to assign.

Shows the result in HTML and permits export it to CSV, text separated by tabs, XML or Excel.

Integrates itself with ActAsAuthenticated plugin.

Manages different profiles that can be used to define different zones of the application database. This functionality helps the user defining queries.

==Install

Prerequisites: In order to show graphs of the application database structure, MetaQuerier needs Graphviz.

1. From the rails application root directory:

      script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/meta-rails/plugins/meta_querier

2. Reload your server and point your browser to the "/meta_querier" folder of your application, for example:

      http://localhost:3000/meta_querier

MetaQuerier looks if you have ActAsAuthenticated plugin installed, if so it calls automatically the function login_required acting as expected.
If you have ActAsAuthenticated plugin installed but you don't want MetaQuerier to use ActAsAuthenticated you must add the next code to config/environment.rb:

	MetaQuerierUseActAsAuth = false

==How it works

During the installation MetaQuerier copy all images, css, ... to the public directory of your rails application,
and creates 2 tables in the database in order to manage queries (you can check this at install.rb)

In the Rails initialization phase MetaQuerier loads the MetaQuerierController (disponible at /meta_querier url of the
application), loads needed libs and models (MetaQuerierQuery and MetaQuerierQueryCondition). If during the installation
the MetaQuerierQuery and MetaQuerierQueryCondition tables weren't created MetaQuerier will fail to initialize (you
can solve this running AddMetaQuerierQueryTables migration by yourself.

If you want to study the initialization process of MetaQuerier in detail, check init.rb file.

User documentation will be soon disponible, there you would be able to understand how can MetaQuerier can be used
once the plugin installed.

==Generate documentation

In order to generate this developer documentation you can execute:

  rake rdoc
