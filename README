== Meta Rails ==
 One of the killer features of Ruby on Rails is DRY (Don't Repeat 
Yourself), this is absolutelly true but when you work a lot with RoR you 
feel that something could be still more DRY. This is the motivation of 
MetaRails.

Mainly, MetaRails is a generator of simple database based web 
applications. Given a db schema it generates automaticly the database, 
the view-insert-modify views for each table of the database or model of 
the application, and inferes the webservices that may play with the 
database data.

Well, but not all the web applications are simple database web 
applications, we know this and because of this we are developing the 
proyect in a modular way using plugins in order to permit developers to 
use only the DRY magic that they need.

You can use each functionality of MetaRails as Ruby on Rails plugins as 
you can see at the next section.

There is a google group for MetaRails questions, bugs and other issues:

There is a Lighthouse project for traking the errors and features:
